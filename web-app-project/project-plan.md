# Project Plan for Web Application

## Project Overview
This web application is designed to provide users with a seamless experience for capturing images, applying filters, and merging them with a selected background. The application will consist of multiple pages, each serving a specific purpose in the image capture and processing workflow.

## Features
1. **Home Page**
   - A welcoming interface with a "Start" button to initiate the photo capture process.

2. **Photo Capture Page**
   - Camera preview to allow users to see what they are capturing.
   - Countdown timer to prepare users for the image capture.
   - Automatic image capture after the countdown.
   - Filter selection options to enhance the captured images.

3. **Processing Page**
   - Display of captured images for review.
   - Options for users to select a background color for merging with the captured images.

4. **Final Page**
   - Presentation of the final merged image with the selected background.
   - A "Download" button to allow users to save the final image to their device.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - `app.js`: Main entry point for application logic and navigation.
  - `camera.js`: Handles camera access and image capture functionality.
  - `filters.js`: Provides filter application functionality for images.
  - `imageProcessing.js`: Contains functions for processing images and merging them with backgrounds using the Canvas API.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Project Structure**
   - Create the necessary directories and files as outlined in the project tree.

2. **Develop Home Page**
   - Implement the HTML structure for the home page with a "Start" button.
   - Style the page using CSS.

3. **Create Photo Capture Page**
   - Set up the camera preview using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`.
   - Implement the countdown timer and automatic image capture.
   - Add filter selection options.

4. **Build Processing Page**
   - Display captured images and provide background color selection options.

5. **Finalize Final Page**
   - Merge the captured images with the selected background.
   - Implement the "Download" functionality for the final image.

6. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test each feature thoroughly to ensure functionality and fix any bugs.

7. **Documentation**
   - Write comprehensive documentation in the README.md file, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.

## Conclusion
This project plan outlines the key features, tech stack, and implementation steps for the web application. By following this plan, we aim to create a user-friendly application that allows for easy image capture and processing.
